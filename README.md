# Data Analysis Tools in Python
This repository contains all the materials for the course and exercises. 

## Installing Anaconda Python
First step required to participate in the exercise is to install anaconda python.
If you already have a working anaconda setup you can go directly to next item. 
Anaconda can be downloaded for all platforms from here anaconda. 
I suggest to use Miniconda, because it is lighter and install fewer unnecessary packages.

To download Anaconda Python on linux open a terminal and type
```bash
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
Then install by typing:
```bash
bash ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```
Follow the instructions to complete the anaconda installation. 
The `Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh` file can be safely deleted.
